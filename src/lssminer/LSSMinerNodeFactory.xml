        <intro>The Longest Shared Sequence Miner looks for the longest subsequence of the test data inside the training sequences.
        As soon as a sequence longer than (bestFound - MaxVariation) is found, it it added to the output table.
        Therefore it it guaranteed that the longest shared sequence is included, but there may be also some former found sequences contained.</intro>
        
        
        <option name="Test Column">Choose the Column (of the test table) which contains the test sequences.</option>
        <option name="Training Column">Choose the Column (of the training table) which contains the training sequences.</option>
        <option name="MaxGapTest">Choose how big the gap may be between two shared characters of the test sequence.</option>
        <option name="MaxGapTraining">Choose how big the gap may be between two shared characters of the training sequence.</option>
        <option name="MinSharedSeqLength">Choose how many shared characters have to be found at least.</option>
        <option name="MaxLengthVariation">New found sequences must not necessarily be longer than the currently best found sequence but may differ by the specified amount of characters.</option>

        <option name="AppendSharedSeq">Append the found shared sequences (this may take 1/5 additional time).</option>
